# Social Blog Project README

This is a simple social network I have created in Django. It allows users to create groups, which others can then join and share posts amongst eachother. There is also a profile for each user, where you can see all activity by that user. 

The project is part of a Django full stack web development course that I have completed and it is used to demonstrate skills that I aquired throughout. 

The design have been left simple on purpose as it was not the key focus. CSS and JS can be added to improve the design as required.

Features:

- 3 Web Apps, working in sync to allow for a dynamic interaction between users yet easily allowing for scaling. 
- Login/registration support with database on site admin.
